# LearningSwift

### What is Swift?
In early June, 2014 Apple dropped a bomb on developers worldwide, unveiling Swift, a new programming language and set of tools for creating dynamic, fast iOS mobile and OS X desktop applications. Although only recently made public, Swift is among the hottest topics in software development.

### Why is it important?
Swift is the preferred language for development of iOS and OS X applications. Apple recommends the use of Swift for all new projects.


### What will you get?
Through heavy use of examples, and coding via the REPL, Playgrounds, and test scaffolding, we’ll spend a day getting to know the Swift programming language. Our focus will be on fostering discussion about the language and hands-on experimentation, as ways understand new material.


### How is this different?
Other classes can teach you how to build apps, and involve a giant (and quite wonderful) world of tools, languages, techniques, and libraries. We’re not going to do that. We’re going to use this course to focus on the Swift programming language.

### Who is this for?
You’re familiar with at least one programming language. You enjoy programming or wish you did. You’re interested in or have experience developing iOS or OS X applications.


### What should I do before this course?
Join in the discussion of what topics should be included in this course, on the course wiki.
